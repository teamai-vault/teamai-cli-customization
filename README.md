# Team AI CLI

[中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

`team-ai` is a thin, Copilot-native control layer for shared GitHub Copilot capabilities. It keeps Agent Plugin packages, the department Marketplace, and project-local `.github/*` customization in their native locations instead of introducing another runtime or plugin format.

The CLI is independent from any particular department Marketplace. Each user configures one Marketplace source; departments can maintain their own Marketplace while using the same CLI.

## Architecture

The CLI has no built-in department Marketplace. `teamai-vault/teamai-marketplace` is the reference/template Marketplace used by this workspace, not a CLI dependency.

## Built-in Agent Skill

The npm package ships a small, self-contained `team-ai` Agent Skill from `skills/team-ai/`. `team-ai init` and `team-ai sync` converge that bundled Skill to:

```text
~/.copilot/skills/team-ai/
```

The Skill teaches an Agent how to route Team AI intent through the public CLI and to use current `--help` output for exact syntax. It does not read or depend on a department Marketplace's files or layout. Its shipped version follows the CLI package version.

Ownership is recorded separately under `~/.team-ai/built-in-skills/`. An existing `~/.copilot/skills/team-ai/` without Team AI CLI ownership is treated as a collision and is never silently overwritten. `doctor` reports missing, stale, or colliding built-in Skill state.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Git
- Optional backend: GitHub Copilot CLI available as `copilot` (native backend), or VS Code available as `code` (fallback backend). Marketplace-managed user instructions are file-based and can converge without either backend; plugin convergence still requires one.

## Development installation

```text
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## Marketplace and plugin contract

`--marketplace` accepts a native Copilot source: a GitHub `owner/repo` reference, a ref-qualified reference, an HTTP(S)/SSH/git URL, or a local path. Relative local paths are normalized to absolute paths before they are persisted. The manifest name is discovered from the registered Marketplace; users do not provide it separately.

Plugin names are the names published by the Marketplace:

```text
common
api
ios
aos
qa
design
```

The plugin name does not encode its kind. The CLI reads the shared metadata namespace `com.company.teamai`:

```json
{
  "name": "api",
  "extensions": {
    "com.company.teamai": {
      "kind": "role"
    }
  }
}
```

`kind` is `common`, `role`, or `project`. A Logical Project may optionally reference one `project` Plugin from `manifest/projects.yaml`.

## Logical Project context and learnings

`team-ai init` configures only user scope and never binds Logical Projects. `team-ai projects list` reads the catalog; `team-ai projects set <ids...>` (repeated or comma-separated IDs) is the only command that changes the current physical Git workspace binding, and `sync` re-converges the saved binding of the current workspace only. Convergence has four scopes: Marketplace Plugin packages and managed user instructions (`init`, `sync`), plus physical-repository Logical Project instructions and physical-repository context/learning files (`projects set`, `sync`).

Active Project instruction files are mirrored byte-for-byte to `.github/instructions/team-ai/<id>/`; project docs and project/shared learnings go to `.team-ai/context/`. Team AI writes one `context.instructions.md` pointer with `applyTo: "**"`, plus Git-resolved `info/exclude` entries for only those two reserved roots. It never adopts an occupied reserved path, even if empty, and never rewrites Marketplace source frontmatter. Portable or path-specific `applyTo` matching remains a documented future validation item; no runtime instruction injection is claimed.

## Marketplace-managed user instructions

An optional Marketplace `instructions/` directory may contain native Copilot instruction files at any depth:

```text
instructions/**/*.instructions.md
```

`team-ai init` and `team-ai sync` mirror those files byte-for-byte into the managed user-level directory `~/.copilot/instructions/team-ai/`, preserving relative paths. The directory is Team AI-owned; keep personal instructions elsewhere under `~/.copilot/instructions/`. File and folder names only organize content—Team AI does not assign company, department, role, or action semantics, and native Copilot frontmatter remains unchanged.

This is the only narrow exception to the prohibition on arbitrary or generic resource copying/injection: the concrete use case is deploying department-approved Copilot user instructions. Marketplace maintainers own and review the content; Team AI owns only `~/.copilot/instructions/team-ai/` and mirrors the frozen `instructions/**/*.instructions.md` contract there. The CLI accepts regular single-link-count files and rejects link-like entries or unsafe source/target boundaries visible during its filesystem checks, writes atomically, and leaves all other user instructions untouched. It does not defend against a separate process replacing an already-checked path during the operation; that race is outside the V1 threat model.

If both Copilot CLI and VS Code are unavailable, `init`/`sync` still converge this file tree but return an error explaining that plugin convergence could not run; the command must not report full initialization or synchronization success.

## First-time initialization

The four first-time interactive combinations are:

```text
team-ai init                                             # prompt for Marketplace, then Role
team-ai init --marketplace <source>                      # prompt for Role
team-ai init --role api                                  # prompt for Marketplace
team-ai init --marketplace <source> --role api           # no prompts
```

In an interactive terminal, the role picker uses the roles exposed by the Marketplace and selects exactly one role. In a non-TTY environment (CI, redirected stdin, or another non-interactive shell), missing values are errors rather than prompts. Supply both values explicitly:

```text
team-ai init --marketplace <source> --role <role>
```

Initialization:

1. checks GitHub Copilot CLI and chooses the native backend when it is available;
2. loads the Marketplace and discovers its manifest name;
3. registers the source through native Copilot operations when needed;
4. installs `common` and every `kind: role` plugin in the catalog;
5. enables only `common` and the selected role;
6. stores the selected role, Marketplace identity, and explicit Team AI ownership;
7. optionally binds Logical Projects and converges their project-scoped context.

Project Plugins are optional executable capabilities. They are declared by a Logical Project manifest and enabled only in the bound physical repository settings.

Example persisted config:

```yaml
version: 1
marketplace:
  name: payments-ai
  source: https://github.com/example-org/payments-ai-marketplace.git
role: api
managedPlugins:
  - common@payments-ai
  - api@payments-ai
  - ios@payments-ai
  - aos@payments-ai
  - qa@payments-ai
  - design@payments-ai
```

The config schema is version `1` and uses `marketplace.source` as its only source field. After initialization, normal commands use the saved Marketplace and refuse a different source instead of silently rebinding.

## Commands

```text
team-ai init [--marketplace <source>] [--role api|ios|aos|qa|design]
team-ai projects [list]
team-ai projects set <ids...>
team-ai learning share <file> [--project <id>|--shared] [--tags <tag...>]
team-ai skill list [--tag <tag>] [--owner <owner>] [--source plugin|standalone]
team-ai skill show <name>
team-ai skill install <name...>
team-ai skill install --tag <tag> [--yes]
team-ai skill remove <name...>
team-ai skill contribute <path> --owner <owner> [--tags <tag...>] --target standalone|plugin [--plugin <plugin>]
team-ai tags list
team-ai sync
team-ai role list
team-ai role set <role>
team-ai status
team-ai doctor
```

All write commands support the global `--dry-run` option. A first-time dry run can inspect the supplied Marketplace and reports planned Marketplace/plugin/config/project changes without mutating state.

`learning share` adds the supplied Markdown body to `learnings/<project>/` through a GitHub pull request. It defaults to the one active Logical Project, uses `shared` with none, and requires `--project` or `--shared` with several. Contributions use an isolated bare clone and worktree; they never change the active Marketplace checkout or shared read cache. A dry run previews the branch, commit, push, and pull-request steps without performing them.

### `team-ai sync`

`sync` means convergence and repair. It installs missing Team AI-owned user plugins, restores enablement, refreshes Marketplace registration, updates VS Code Marketplace registration, refreshes project machine state, and repairs managed personal Skills. It does not copy central Skills, Agents, Instructions, Hooks, or MCP definitions into the project.

### `team-ai skill` and `team-ai tags`

Skill reads use the saved Marketplace cache. The catalog scans Plugin-contained and top-level Skills, then reads owner/tags/standalone governance from `skills.yaml`. `skill install --tag` resolves the current matching names and stores those explicit names; tags are not subscriptions. Top-level Skills are copied byte-for-byte to `~/.copilot/skills/<name>/`. Explicitly standalone Plugin Skills are copied there only when the containing Plugin is not already enabled. Existing unowned personal Skill directories are refused; `skill remove` deletes only recorded Team AI-owned copies.

`skill contribute` sends a local Skill directory through the same isolated GitHub worktree and PR flow as `learning share`. It requires an owner and target; plugin targets also require an existing Marketplace plugin. The command checks `SKILL.md`, unsafe paths, name collisions, and `skills.yaml` metadata, but does not provide a Skill quality-lint command.

### `team-ai role`

```text
team-ai role list
team-ai role set qa
```

Changing role keeps all Team AI role plugins installed, enables `common` plus the new role, and disables the other Team AI-owned roles. A pre-existing user-owned plugin is preserved and is never claimed from its name alone.

### `team-ai status` and `team-ai doctor`

`status` reports Marketplace revision, selected Logical Projects, managed personal Skills, Project context, and learning projection. `doctor` reuses dry-run convergence against the locally loaded cache to report stale context, missing or colliding owned Skills, invalid active Project bindings, and optional Plugin inconsistencies without repairing them. Neither command refreshes a remote Marketplace cache. Hook declarations are validated as Marketplace content, but the CLI does not execute Hooks or pretend that unavailable runtime inspection succeeded.

## Native Copilot and VS Code-only fallback

When `copilot` is available, Team AI uses the native command family:

```text
copilot plugins marketplace add ...
copilot plugins marketplace list --json
copilot plugins marketplace browse <name> --json
copilot plugins install ...
copilot plugins enable ...
copilot plugins disable ...
copilot plugins update ...
```

When Copilot CLI is unavailable but `code` is available, Team AI uses a VS Code-compatible fallback. It reads the same Marketplace/plugin contract, materializes managed plugins into the Copilot-compatible location, and merges Copilot metadata:

```text
~/.copilot/installed-plugins/<marketplace>/<plugin>
~/.copilot/config.json
~/.copilot/settings.json
```

The fallback writes `installedPlugins` inventory and `enabledPlugins` state, while keeping `settings.json.enabledPlugins` as effective enablement authority and mirroring the inventory flag. Unknown fields and existing `source_sha` values are preserved; fallback-created rows do not calculate a synthetic `source_sha`.

## Copilot and VS Code Marketplace registration

User-level Copilot registration is represented by `extraKnownMarketplaces` in `~/.copilot/settings.json`. The real Copilot backend lets native Copilot own that update; the fallback merges only the configured Marketplace entry and preserves unknown/native fields.

Team AI also registers the source in VS Code User Settings under `chat.plugins.marketplaces`. The merge is JSONC-safe: comments, trailing commas, unknown settings, and existing entries are preserved, while the configured source is inserted or moved to index `0`.

Logical Project projections use `.github/instructions/team-ai/**` and `.team-ai/context/**`; both reserved paths are rejected when unowned. Optional Project Plugin settings are read-modify-written only for explicitly owned entries.

## Ownership and project state

`managedPlugins` is the ownership boundary. Team AI may install, enable, disable, update, or repair only plugins it explicitly installed or claimed during convergence. User-owned and third-party plugin state remains untouched.

The real business Git repository is the Project scope. Project-specific Copilot customization stays in `.github/*`; Project is not a Plugin type. Machine state is partitioned by the stable Git project anchor:

```text
~/.team-ai/
  config.yaml
  projects/
    <safe-anchor>-<hash>/
      anchor
      state.json
```

## Marketplace rename utility

The checked-in `scripts/rename-marketplace.mjs` is a Marketplace maintainer utility. It changes the logical Marketplace ID inside the target Marketplace repository and does not modify the generic CLI or user-owned machine/project state.

```text
npm run rename:marketplace -- --from teamai --to payments-platform-ai --dry-run
npm run rename:marketplace -- --from teamai --to payments-platform-ai --display-name "Payments Platform AI"
```

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md).

## Validation and tests

```text
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e:copilot
npm run test:e2e:fallback
npm test
```

The two E2E scripts create isolated temporary profiles and repositories. `test:e2e:copilot` verifies projected instruction bytes and native instruction listing by name/scope/source, plus exact native paths for a real personal Skill and an enabled Plugin Skill. `test:e2e:fallback` requires `TEAM_AI_E2E_CODE_BIN` or a working `code` command, validates it with the isolated profile, then exercises the VS Code-only materializer and native recognition of the materialized state. Resource listing is not proof that a model read ignored docs or applied `applyTo`; that authenticated model-read probe remains unverified. The latest branch evidence is recorded in [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md).

## Non-goals

This project does not implement a default Marketplace, multiple-Marketplace merge/overlay/precedence, a package manager, another agent runtime, an IDE abstraction, custom Plugin/Skill/Hook/MCP formats, arbitrary or generic resource copying/injection beyond the documented user and Logical Project projections, a generic overlay engine, telemetry, dashboards, knowledge retrieval/ranking, or a custom business-context database.
